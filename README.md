# medical_documentation_system
A Java program that functions as a prototype for an occupational therapy documentation system.

I am a developer and a pediatric occupational therapist.  For my final project in my Advanced Java class, I created a medical documentation system prototype for my private practice.

* Reads from a list of patients (a csv file)
* Creates a file for each patient
* Allows creation of either a daily note (used for each therapy visit) or a progress note (written every three months)
* Notes are written to the patient's file and are not editable once they are written (for HIPAA compliance)
* Note dates are not editable by the therapist (for HIPAA compliance)
* Each patient's complete file can be viewed by the therapist through the interface
* The FILEPATH variable in the Clinic class must be changed in order to write files to a particular computer
